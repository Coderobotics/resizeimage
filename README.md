I Built an AI Image Resizer, Compressor, and Upscaler App in Replit.

I thought of trying clone of resizeimage.io website

This project has Image Resizer, Image Compressor, and Image Upscaler for unlimited images uploading and downloading.

Initially, I thought of developing it on PHP or Python, but I thought about trying some AI tools.

Finally I decided to try it on Replit.

I built an AI image resizer, compressor, and upscaler app using React + Node.js — all in minutes

I also downloaded the code and configured it on VS code and ran it, it is working fine.

This was really amazing.

If I would have started coding not sure how many days It would take me to complete.

But Replit did my job in minutes.
